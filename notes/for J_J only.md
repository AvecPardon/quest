This is a beta-test run through for J_J. If you are not J_J, do not read!

I would suggest taking some time to think about the UI, rather than using the Quest defaults.

In the comments below, a line starting - is my comment, a line starting -> is my suggestion, any other line is copied from the game. I hope it makes sense!

```

You can see a clock, a psychic seven ball, a fish tank, a fish, a blue book, a green book, a red book, a package of pads, an Air Fresh, a phone, a plant, a pencil, a blanket, a sandwich, a cat statue, a cat and a door.
- It would be better to write prose, and have these as scenery items. This is just a shopping list.

You hear the faint humming sound of the air filter.
-> You hear the faint humming of the air filter.

You can smell the rich nutty smell of peanut pumpkin soup from the kitchen.
-> You can smell the rich nutty aroma of peanut pumpkin soup from the kitchen.

- I notice ID does not have a "drop" verb displayed for it, but you can drop it via the command line. I guess one of these is wrong, probably the command line drop, as you cannot then pick it up again.

- pet paperwork has a "use" verb, but I just get the deault "You can't use it." response.

print your concert ticket 
- What concert? Maybe this is clear later

> ask ball about cat
You need it. 
> ask ball about paperwork
...or you could not waste all your time asking questions to an inanimate object.
- I was not sure what was a response from the ball and what is a comment from the parser, as both these were in italics. Pretty sure the second should not be.

> get fish food
You can't take it.
- why not?

> look at blue book
The book is a sturdy hardcover. The Science of Chaos it says across its spine. You had to buy it for one of your classes before you dropped out. What a waste of money.
- would you not refer to it as The "Science of Chaos" or perhaps "science book" or "dumb science book" rather than blue book?

> look at green book
It's a photo album. Your mom liked to have printed copies of photos. 
- again, call it a photo album - that is how it appears in the inventory

You don't feel like reading anymore.
-> You don't feel like reading any more.

> use pads
You can't use it.
- should say "them", but as it is also a package of pads, that will not be easy!

The Air Fresh has small door on the back of it and on the front it has a pad to buy air filter credits.
-> The Air Fresh has a small door on the back of it and on the front it has a pad to buy air filter credits.
- Is this "pad" different to the package of pads? Pretty sure it is, so might be good to say keypad or something else here

> use air
Please choose which 'air' you mean:
1: Air Fresh
2: puddle of water
3: air filter credits
4: Air Fresh door
- puddle of water is air?

such sparse pale threads that you can't hardly see it.
-> such sparse pale threads that you can hardly see it.
- Your way may be colloquial


> use phone to read fresh
I can't see that.
> read fresh with phone
Life never smelled so sweet. Cobri Air Fresh: the freshest air.
- Be great if the first worked too.

> read fish with phone
You can't read it.
- Scope here for a clever reply

> read fresh with phone
Please choose which 'fresh' you mean:
1: Air Fresh
2: puddle of water
3: Air Fresh door
- One of these does nothing, the other two are the same. If you can, get it so there is no disambig. here.

> read poster with phone
You lift up your phone and type in the read function. It takes you to the Space Punk website.
- maybe need preamble like this when you first read anything with the phone

- i do not need to be holding the phone to read stuff with it

> water plant
With which object?
1: blue book
2: pet paperwork
3: flight info
4: Cobri letter
5: torn paper
6: clock
7: psychic seven ball
8: fish tank
9: fish
10: green book
11: red book
12: package of pads
13: Air Fresh
14: phone
15: pencil
16: blanket
17: sandwich
18: cat statue
19: cat
20: ID
21: door
22: fish food
- well none of that lot obviously!

- pencil has a "pack" verb, but nothing else I looked at does.

> get blanket
You can't take it.
- why?

... It doesn't look rotten.
- which is like a red flag that it is, otherwise why mention it!

The pickles go so good with the cheese.
-> The pickles go so well with the cheese.

> look at cat statue
It is a glass statue shaped like a cat. It is a swirling blue color, and it is very fragile. Your mother made it.
- statue makes me think of something person-sized. Perhaps statuette or figurine?

> look at left cupboard
Underneath the sink is a cupboard.
- okay, but what does it look like?

> clean dishes
You add some soap to the sink and wash the dishes. It reminds you of being small and helping your father in the kitchen. His hands were rough from the work he did. 
"Thank you," says your grandma.
- other times i get told i do not have time as i have to pack, so odd that i have time to do this

You had forgotten what it smelled like until this very moment. You ball up your fists and stuff them into your pocket.
- the second sentence does not seem to follow. perhaps add it to the start of the next para?

You're not sure if it's worse knowing someone is dead or gone.
-> You're not sure if it's worse knowing someone is dead or they are gone and you just do not know what happened.

Even though you are only being gone for three months
-> Even though you will only be gone for three months


You don't feel so good. You think if you drink water it will settle your stomach.
- repeats too often. Some variety would be good, even if it only said "You think if you drink water it will settle your stomach." every fifth time.

> get cup
You can't take it.
- I am in a kitchen, with a stack of clean dishes, I should be able to find a cup, and if not, i need to know why

> x cup
It is a cup.
- so there is a cup here, despite not being listed, I just cannot take it.

> drink milk
Maybe you should fill a cup with milk if you want a drink.
- so I do need the cup!

> ask grandma about cup
You decide not to ask about that right now. You having packing to do, and you're feeling kinda stressed.
- i am feeling stressed because I cannot pickup the cup to get a drink

> ask grandma about moon
"What a wonderful chance for you."
- chance for what?

It is a Cobri brand Cook n' Stuff oven.
-> It is a Cobri brand Cook 'n' Stuff oven.
- maye brand should be italics?

On top of the microwave is some cans of vegetables and instant mash.
-> On top of the microwave are some cans of vegetables and instant mash.

The trash can is short and made of a black plastic.
-> The trash can is small and made of a black plastic.

> look at bag of flour
It is a bag of Cobri brand white flour.
> look at box of cornmeal
It is a box of Cobri brand cornmeal.
- Can you give more descriptions? Perhaps there is a competition on the packet or nutrition info or whatever? What colour or size? etc. This is true of lots of others items too.

There is chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry flavors.
-> There are chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry flavors.

> look at carrots
It is a bundle of six or seven carrots. Some are bright orange, some are yellow, and one is a dark purple. 
> x purple carrot
It is a bundle of six or seven carrots. Some are bright orange, some are yellow, and one is a dark purple. 
- no, the purple one is just one carrot

> look out window
I can't see that.
- yes you can

- stuff that is packed just goes into your inventory, it would be better if there was a chest or suitcase or whatever tha they went into, especially as items cannot be taken, but can be packed
> get green
Do you want to pack it?
> pack green
You pack the photo album. It is all janky and water damaged, but it's sentimental.
- get and pack do the same thing, so why does get not work?

> pack all
I can't see that. (all)
- implement
